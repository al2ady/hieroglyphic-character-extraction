# Hieroglyphic Character Extraction using Image Processing

This project focuses on extracting hieroglyphic characters from images using classical image processing techniques implemented in Python.  
It demonstrates a complete preprocessing pipeline for segmenting and isolating characters from complex backgrounds.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
Hieroglyphic images often contain noise, low contrast, and complex backgrounds.  
The goal of this project is to preprocess such images and extract individual characters clearly so they can be used for further analysis, recognition, or machine learning tasks.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔧 Image Processing Pipeline
The project follows these main steps:
1. Load the input image
2. Convert the image to grayscale
3. Apply binary thresholding
4. Remove noise and small artifacts
5. Use Connected Components Labeling to detect individual characters
6. Extract and save each character separately
